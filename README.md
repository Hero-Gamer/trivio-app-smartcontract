## 🧩 Problem

Learning Bitcoin is confusing and boring for newcomers — existing tools fail to keep people engaged or rewarded.

## 💡 Solution

Quiz Brain — a fun quiz app that rewards users in sats/STX/sBTC for correct answers, turning learning into a game and a gateway to Bitcoin.

## 🚀 Market Validation & Why It Matters

Taps into the **$11.8B brain training / trivia app market (projected $115.8B by 2034, +25.8% CAGR)** — huge Web2 user base ready for Web3.

Bridges gaming + education → direct crypto adoption.

## 🔗 Bitcoin / Stacks Fit

Uses Bitcoin L2 Stacks' micropayments for instant sat rewards.

Roadmap: More Stacks smart contracts functionalities + NFTs for leaderboards and achievements + embedded wallet for mass onboarding + Add Stacks project specific categories + Add more questions and levels.

Converts curiosity → wallets → on-chain actions.

## 🧩 Core loop (MVP)
1. Login – one-tap Turnkey sign-in (or mock).
2. Play quiz – 3 questions/day, AI-pre-generated batch.
3. Earn points – instant feedback animation → “+20 Sats Points!”
4. Claim reward – “Claim your reward!” CTA after X points → Stacks NFT mint or simulated mint via ZeroAuthority.
5. Share moment – generates image + link card (“I just claimed sats on Bitcoin Brain 💥”).

## ⚙️ Feasibility

Clickable prototype live.

Pilot tests: 45% retention, strong reward engagement. Free Daily Claims brings users back regularly.

Built to scale across topics and sponsored quizzes. Reserve spaces for advertisers to catch eye balls.

## 🌍 Impact

Quiz Brain turns crypto learning into viral entertainment, helping onboard the next wave of Bitcoin + Stacks users.

## 🎯 Goals
Business goals
- Ship a live MVP that feels magical and share-worthy.
- Drive daily engagement (repeat plays > 5 days).
- Demonstrate on-chain rewards + social virality in one seamless flow.

User goals
- Play a short, smart quiz daily (1–5 min).
- Earn visible Sats Points and occasionally claim “real” Bitcoin collectibles.
- Share wins instantly on X to flex and recruit friends.

## 🔗 Post-Hackathon commitment

If I win, or if there will be further funding available, I'd look to develop this idea further:

Priority 1:
* work towards mobile first app
* add embedded wallet 

Priority 2:
* add more Stacks and Bitcoin content
* add more Stacks projects specific content such as Bitflow
* add more questions to each non-web3 category
* add localization / support multiple languages such as Spanish and Korean, perhaps more
* add more onchain smart contract functionalities
